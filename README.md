# 🌍 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## 📘 Project Description

The **COVID-19 Global Data Tracker** is a data analysis project designed to monitor and visualize the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic using real-world data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus). It leverages Python and data science libraries to analyze trends in cases, deaths, and vaccinations over time and across countries.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Load, clean, and preprocess COVID-19 global data.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to discover trends.
- Visualize COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations using various charts.
- Compare countries’ performance and analyze key metrics.
- Create an interactive choropleth map showing global case density.
- Document insights and provide a narrative based on data.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python** (v3.8+)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **pandas** – data manipulation
- **numpy** – numerical computation
- **matplotlib** – data visualization
- **seaborn** – advanced statistical plots
- **plotly express** – interactive visualizations
- **nbconvert** – for exporting the notebook

### 2. Launch Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook COVID19_Global_Data_Tracker.ipynb

### 3. Run All Cells
Explore the outputs, charts, and insights step by step.

## 📊 Visualizations Included
- **Line Chart:** Total cases and deaths over time
- **Bar Chart:** Top 10 countries by total cases
- **Line Plot:** Daily new cases comparison across selected countries
- **Calculated Metric:** Death rate = total_deaths / total_cases
- **Heatmap:** Correlation between key COVID-19 indicators
- **Choropleth Map:** Total cases per country on the latest date (interactive)
## 🔍 Key Insights
-United States, India, and Brazil consistently reported the highest number of total cases.
-Countries with higher testing rates often showed higher case detection rates.
-Death rates varied significantly across regions, hinting at differences in healthcare capacity.
-Vaccination rollout showed rapid growth in high-income countries.
-Several low-income countries had suspiciously low case and death counts, possibly due to underreporting or limited testing.
